# 10 Priority Requirements
1. User can inform robot of an allergy
   a. We believe this is the most import requirment because the robot could put the customers life at risk if this function is not included
2. Robot will follow food saftey standards
   a. We believe this is next on the priority list because it's important to make sure the customer isnt getting sick
3. Robot will be fully autonomous
   a. The customer needs to be able to allow the robot to cook on their own without having to be checked on
